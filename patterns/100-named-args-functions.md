# 100-Named-Args Functions

#### example [`HundredNamedArgsFunctions.re`](./100-named-args-functions/HundredNamedArgsFunctions.re)

Normally, when I see that a function is growing in number of arguments, like
this:

```reason
let purchase_item:
  (
    ~quantity: int,
    ~user_id: User.id=?,
    ~cart_id: Cart.id=?,
    ~purchased_at: Datetime.t,
    ~should_email: Email_preference.t=?
    ~history_status: Purchase_history.Status.t=?,
    ~trace: Tracer.t=?,
    Item.t
  ) =>
  result(_, _);
```

I start to wonder if there's some datatype hidden in those parameters that
should be discovered.

For example, perhaps we want to put together a _purchase order_ that includes
some of the purchase information:

```reason
module Purchase_order: {
  type t;
  let make: (~purchased_at: DateTime.t=?, ~quantity: int, Item.t) => t;
} = {
  type t = {
    purchased_at: DateTime.t,
    quantity: int,
    item: Item.t,
  };
  let make = (~purchased_at, ~quantity, item) => /* ... */ ();
};
```

And also a _purchase preferences_ value that includes settings such as whether
an email should be sent, or if this purchase should be hidden from history:

```reason
module Purchase_preference: {
  type t;
  let make:
    (
      ~should_email: Email_preference.t=?,
      ~history_status: Purchase_history.Status.t=?
    ) =>
    t;
} = {
  type t = {
    should_email: Email_preference.t,
    history_status: Purchase_history.Status.t,
  };
  let make = (~should_email, ~history_status) => /* ... */ ();
};
```

The user and cart seem tied together, and could perhaps live in a _shopping
session_ value that tells you what user and what cart are being used:

```reason
module Shopping_session: {
  type t;
  let make: (~user: User.t, ~cart: Cart.t) => t;
} = {
  type t = {
    user: User.t,
    cart: Cart.t,
  };
  let make = (~user: User.t, ~cart: Cart.t) => {
    {user, cart};
  };
};
```

Finally we can tie all of these new values together and our `purchase_item`
function looks like this:

```reason
let purchase_item:
  (
    ~trace: Tracer.t=?,
    ~sess=Shopping_session.t,
    ~prefs=Purchase_preference.t,
    Purchase_order.t
  ) =>
  result(_, _);
```

Which I'd argue is much easier to digest, and lets me choose whether I want to
know more about the shopping session, the preferences of the purchase, or the
order itself.

Keep in mind that these two approaches have very different runtime
characteristics, and if performance or memory are constrained for your use case
you may need to live with functions that have plenty of arguments.
